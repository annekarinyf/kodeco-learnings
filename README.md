# Kodeco Learnings :hourglass:

Hi! In this repository I'm storing the apps I'm developing while I'm doing Kodeco courses. I decided to start the iOS learning path from zero, so this repository contains from basic to advanced iOS development.


## 01 - Your First iOS & SwiftUI App: An App from Scratch
* Introduction to SwiftUI (different Views and modifiers).
* Introduction to app architecture concepts, TDD and Unit Tests.
